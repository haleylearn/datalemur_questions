WITH count_confirmed AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT email_id) AS cnt_confirmed FROM texts WHERE signup_action = 'Confirmed'
)
,  total_email_id AS (
  SELECT COUNT(email_id) AS total_email_id FROM texts
)
SELECT ROUND((cnt_confirmed ::NUMERIC) / (total_email_id ::NUMERIC), 2) AS confirm_rate
FROM count_confirmed, total_email_id
