---------- SOLUTION 1: Using Window Function DENSE_RANK and CTE ----------

WITH latest_transactions AS (
  SELECT 
    transaction_date, 
    user_id, 
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(
      PARTITION BY user_id 
      ORDER BY 
        transaction_date DESC
    ) AS latest_purchase 
  FROM

) 
SELECT 
  transaction_date, 
  user_id, 
  COUNT(user_id) AS purchase_count 
FROM 
  latest_transactions 
WHERE 
  latest_purchase = 1 
GROUP BY
